# 📅 Schedulr: Your Class Timetable → Calendar Exporter

Schedulr is a simple yet powerful web app that helps primarily students turn boring timetable entries into sleek, recurring calendar events, in seconds!

## 🎯 What Is It Exactly?

Building this came from a personal experience. At the start of school, I always wanted my school timetable in my native calendar app, without having to put everything in one-by-one (mainly because I saw it to be stressful and a long process), especially because I was now getting used to the schedule. My school uses MyCamu for our course registration and it has no in-built way to export your timetable to your native calendar app. So I was like `f*** it`, i'll just build something to help me. And this is what brought about Schedulr! 
This platform makes it effortless to:

✅ Create your class timetable with an intuitive interface  
✅ Set up semester durations and breaks  
✅ Preview your weekly schedule visually  
✅ Export it as a `.ics` file compatible with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook  
✅ Access your schedules across different devices (using your Google Account)
